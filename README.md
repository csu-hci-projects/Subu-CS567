This is a simple application that has been developed for HoloLens (1st Generation). This application renders a webpage inside a 3D application and mainly aims at helping the users repair a faulty device. The main device that this applicaiton focusses is on toaster and a web page that has clear step by step instruction to repair some of the parts of various different type of toaster are available in the website. This website gets loaded once the application starts so that the users can easily navigate from there.
